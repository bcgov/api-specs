# Geomark Web Service
# Developer Guide
This guide is aimed at developers and web masters that would like to incorporate the Physical Address Geocoder into their applications and websites. 
<br>
## Introduction
The Geomark Web Service allows you to create and share geographic areas of interest over the web in a variety of formats and coordinate systems. This service is especially helpful when you need to share an area of interest with people who require that the data be in a different format, or they use different mapping software.
Geomarks are immutable and expire after 90 days.

A full list of materials and Geomark web applications can be found at the **[Geomark homepage](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=F6BAF45131954020BCFD2EBCC456F084)**.

## Get information about a particular geomark
* The attribution of a Geomark can be downloaded in several file formats.

https://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/geomark/geomarks/**(GEOMARK ID).(FILE FORMAT)**
```console
https://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/geomark/geomarks/gm-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv0bcislands.json
```

## Get geomark feature
* The geomark feature resource returns a single spatial feature with either a single (Point, LineString, Polygon) or multi-part geometry (MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon) and the geomark attribution. 

https://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/geomark/geomarks/**(GEOMARK ID)**/feature.json
```console
https://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/geomark/geomarks/gm-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv0bcislands/feature.json
```
